/*
root.creatElement() function is used to create a new element  JAVASCRIPT OBJECT 
        React.createElement() returns a new React element.
        this function takes three parameters:
        1. the type of element we want to create
        2. an object containing the attributes of the element
        3. the children of the element

        important things if i ask you what is heading in it,
        here 'heading' is an object with properties like className, xyz, and children
        className is used to add class to the element
        xyz is used to add an attribute to the element
        children is used to add text to the element
        Here is one concept children and props to elements
        props are used to pass data from parent to child component
        like in this case, we are adding class and attribute 'xyz' to the h1 element
        children is used to add text to the element
        xyz is used to add an attribute to the element
        xyz is a custom attribute and it can be used in any element in react
        you can add any attribute to an element in react by adding them as key-value pair in the object passed to the element.
        

    IMP THINGS WHAT IS PROPS 
    { }=== props
        //props are used to pass data from parent to child component
       ********* props: {className: 'heading', xyz: 'abc' children: 'Hello World! from React' },

        console.log(heading); //<h1 class="heading" xyz="abc">Hello World! from React</h1>
